# Wines Of Crete

This is a project of class CS-360 from the University of Crete Department of Computer Science, that was completed cooperatively by me an two other students.

SQL database construction and building an online shop, for Crete wine makers network, using Java Servlets.

This project was for a "Files and Databases" course, so it is focused in the database compartment and not so on the web site compartment.
